# Repository with code examples

This repository contains a collection of code examples to help you learn and \
understand various concepts and techniques in development. Each example is \
designed to demonstrate a specific feature, pattern, or functionality in a \
concise and practical way.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

    npm install
    ```

4. Explore the examples:

The examples are organized into directories based on their respective topics. \
Each example directory contains a README.md file that provides an overview of \
the example and instructions on how to run it. Additionally, you'll find the \
source code files for the example.

## Examples

The repository covers a wide range of topics and will include examples such as:

- Basic server setup

- CRUD operations with `MongoDB`

- Working with `asynchronou`s code (Promises, async/await, callbacks)

- File system operations (`node:fs`)

- Authentication and authorization

- Handling `HTTP` requests and responses

- Working with WebSocket using (`node:ws`)

- Integrating with external APIs

And much more!
